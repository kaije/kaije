## Hey there! I'm Kelly, a full stack developer from Brisbane Australia.

💻 I'm currently working on building up a public dev portfolio here on GitHub, but here are a few of the things I've worked with recently in my day job:

🎯 I'm currently focused on:

- Getting started on contributing to open source projects of interest
- Learning more about developer portals, particularly Spotify's [Backstage](https://backstage.io/)
- Technical writing, better documentation, and 'docs like code'
- Exploring other cloud service providers including GCP and Azure
- CI/CD, DevOps and site reliability engineering
- Effective monitoring & telemetry
- Mastering Kotlin and TypeScript
- Venturing into .NET and C#
- Levelling up on Linux 🐧

❔ When I'm not doing dev stuff, I'm:

- 📚👀 Reading
- 💬:de: Attempting to learn German to at least a [B2 level](https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/kup/kon/stu.html)
- 💪:sweat_smile: Trying to build enough upper body strength to someday do an unassisted pull-up
- ✈️🌏 Travelling (16 countries so far, but currently on hold due to the pandemic - hopefully not for much longer!)
