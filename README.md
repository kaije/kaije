## Hey there!

I'm Kelly, a full stack developer from Brisbane Australia.

I'm currently focused on:

- Kotlin and TypeScript
- Venturing into .NET and C#
- Learning more about developer portals, particularly Spotify's [Backstage](https://backstage.io/)
- Technical writing, better documentation, and docs like code

When I'm not doing dev-related stuff, I'm:

- 📚👀 Reading
- 💬:de: Attempting to learn German to at least a [B2 level](https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/kup/kon/stu.html)
- 💪:sweat_smile: Trying to build enough upper body strength to someday do an unassisted pull-up
- ✈️🌏 Travelling (16 countries so far, but currently on hold due to the pandemic - hopefully not for much longer!)
