## Hey there! I'm Kelly, a full stack developer from Brisbane Australia.

💻 I'm currently working on building up a public dev portfolio, but here are a few of the things I've done recently in my day job:

- Built and deployed several serverless functions using Kotlin, the [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework and AWS Lambda
- Helped design and deploy a cost-efficient, cloud-based infrastructure for running scheduled functional tests on our private hosts using [Browserstack Local Testing with Automate](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing/automate), AWS Lambda, and ECS Fargate
- Built a custom web component using the Stencil.js framework, deployed it to AWS S3 and CloudFront, and embedded the result in our staff portal
- Helped enforce appropriate data retention policies by automating data cleanup across our AWS S3 and DynamoDB infrastructure
- Helped implement and evolve our CI/CD pipelines in Bitbucket
- Written a _lot_ of documentation for various audiences - which is totally fine, because I happen to love writing documentation!

🎯 I'm currently focused on:

- Getting started with open source contributions on projects of interest
- Learning more about developer portals, particularly Spotify's [Backstage](https://backstage.io/)
- Technical writing, better documentation, and 'docs like code'
- Exploring other cloud service providers including GCP and Azure
- CI/CD, DevOps and site reliability engineering
- Effective monitoring & telemetry
- Mastering Kotlin and TypeScript
- Trying out C#
- Levelling up on Linux 🐧

❔ When I'm not doing dev stuff, I'm:

- 📚👀 Reading
- 💬:de: Attempting to learn German to at least a [B2 level](https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/kup/kon/stu.html) (it's going very, very slowly)
- 💪:sweat_smile: Trying to build enough upper body strength to someday do an unassisted pull-up
- ✈️🌏 Travelling (16 countries so far, but currently on hold due to the pandemic - hopefully not for much longer!)
