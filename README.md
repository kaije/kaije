Hi there, I'm Kelly. I'm a full stack developer from Brisbane, Australia.

‚úîÔ∏è A few of the things I've done recently in my day job:

- Built and deployed several serverless functions using Kotlin, [the Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) and AWS Lambda
- Helped develop and evolve my team's CI/CD pipelines using Bitbucket Pipelines
- Helped design and deploy a cost-efficient, cloud-based infrastructure for running functional tests on our private hosts using BrowserStack, AWS Lambda, and ECS Fargate
- Built a custom web component using the Stencil.js framework, deployed it to AWS S3 and CloudFront, and embedded the result in our staff portal
- Written vast amounts of documentation for various audiences - which is fine, because I actually like writing docs!

üëÄ I'm currently focused on:

- Developer Portals and Spotify's Backstage
- Technical writing, better documentation, docs like code
- Extending cloud development skills beyond AWS by exploring GCP and Azure
- CI/CD, DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering
- Monitoring & Telemetry
- Mastering Kotlin and TypeScript
- Trying out C#
- Levelling up on Linux
