Hi there! I'm Kelly, a full stack developer from Brisbane Australia.

I'm currently working on building up a public dev portfolio here on GitHub, but here are a few of the things I've done recently in my day job:

- Built and deployed several serverless functions using Kotlin, [the Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) and AWS Lambda
- Helped design and deploy a cost-efficient, cloud-based infrastructure for running scheduled functional tests on our private hosts using [Browserstack Local Testing with Automate](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing/automate), AWS Lambda, and ECS Fargate
- Built a custom web component using the Stencil.js framework, deployed it to AWS S3 and CloudFront, and embedded the result in our staff portal
- Helped enforce appropriate data retention policies by automating data cleanup across our AWS S3 and DynamoDB infrastructure
- Helped implement and evolve our CI/CD pipelines in Bitbucket
- Written a _lot_ of documentation for various audiences - which is totally fine, because I happen to love writing documentation!

I'm currently focused on:

- Learning more about developer portals, particularly Spotify's Backstage
- Technical writing, better documentation, and docs like code
- Exploring other cloud providers including GCP and Azure
- CI/CD, DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering
- Effective monitoring & telemetry
- Mastering Kotlin and TypeScript
- Trying out C#
- Levelling up on Linux 🐧

When I'm not doing dev stuff, I'm:

- 📚👀 Reading (I track this over on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5689474?shelf=read))
- 💬:de: Attempting to learn German to at least a [B2 level](https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/kup/kon/stu.html) (it's going very, very slowly)
- 💪:sweat_smile: Trying to build enough upper body strength to someday do an unassisted pull-up
- ✈️🌏 Travelling (currently on hold due to the pandemic, but hopefully not for much longer)
