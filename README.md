Hi there! I'm Kelly, a full stack developer from Brisbane Australia.

I'm currently working on building up a public dev portfolio here on GitHub, but here are a few of the things I've done recently in my day job:

- Built and deployed several serverless functions using Kotlin, [the Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) and AWS Lambda
- Helped develop and evolve my team's CI/CD pipelines using Bitbucket Pipelines
- Helped design and deploy a cost-efficient, cloud-based infrastructure for running functional tests on our private hosts using BrowserStack, AWS Lambda, and ECS Fargate
- Built a custom web component using the Stencil.js framework, deployed it to AWS S3 and CloudFront, and embedded the result in our staff portal
- Written vast amounts of documentation for various audiences - which is fine, because I actually like writing docs!

I'm currently focused on:

- Learning more about Developer Portals, particularly Spotify's Backstage
- Technical writing, better documentation, and docs like code
- Exploring other cloud providers including GCP and Azure
- CI/CD, DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering
- Monitoring & Telemetry
- Mastering Kotlin and TypeScript
- Trying out C#
- Levelling up on Linux 🐧

When I'm not doing dev stuff, I'm:

- 📚 Reading (I track this over on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5689474-kelly-farlow))
- :de: Attempting to learn German to at least a B2 level (it's going very, very slowly)
- ✈️🌏 Travelling (currently on hold due to the pandemic, but hopefully not for much longer)
